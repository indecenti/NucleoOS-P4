# Buttons Trail

Buttons Trail di Press Play On Tape: un rompicapo in cui segui una scia di pulsanti, ognuno indica dove andare dopo.

## Comandi

La croce direzionale muove, A e B funzionano come sull'Arduboy (le schermate del gioco indicano cosa fanno).

- **Touch**: croce direzionale a sinistra, **A** e **B** a destra (A in basso, B in alto, come sull'Arduboy). Più dita insieme funzionano.
- **Gamepad** USB o Bluetooth: croce o levetta sinistra; A, X e Start = A; B e Y = B.
- **Tastiera USB**: frecce o WASD; Spazio/X/Invio = A; Z/C/Backspace = B.
- **MENU** (in alto a sinistra), i dorsali L/R, Select o il tasto Guide del gamepad mettono in pausa.

## Il menu di pausa

**Continua**, **Zoom** 5x, 6x o 7x (a 7x lo schermo è più grande e i comandi touch sono nascosti: comodo con gamepad o tastiera), **Colori** (bianco, ambra, verde, blu, LCD), **Audio** acceso o spento, **Esci**. Zoom, colori e audio restano memorizzati. Il gesto indietro del sistema apre il menu; ripetuto, esce.

## Salvataggi

La EEPROM dell'Arduboy (1 KB, dove i giochi tengono record e progressi) è salvata nella cartella dell'app poco dopo ogni scrittura e all'uscita.

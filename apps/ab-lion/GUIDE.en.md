# Lion

Lion by Press Play On Tape, in the style of the old handheld games: keep the lions in their cage by blocking them with your chair.

## Controls

The D-pad moves, A and B act as on the Arduboy (the game's own screens say which does what).

- **Touch**: D-pad on the left, **A** and **B** on the right (A lower, B upper, as on the Arduboy). Several fingers at once work.
- **Gamepad** (USB or Bluetooth): D-pad or left stick; A, X and Start = A; B and Y = B.
- **USB keyboard**: arrows or WASD; Space/X/Enter = A; Z/C/Backspace = B.
- **MENU** (top left), the L/R shoulders, Select or the pad's Guide button pause the game.

## The pause menu

**Resume**, **Zoom** 5x, 6x or 7x (7x is the biggest picture and hides the touch controls: best with a gamepad or keyboard), **Colours** (white, amber, green, blue, LCD), **Sound** on or off, **Exit**. Zoom, colours and sound are remembered. The system back gesture opens the menu; a second one exits.

## Saving

The Arduboy EEPROM (1 KB, where games keep high scores and progress) is saved in the app's folder shortly after every write and when the app closes.

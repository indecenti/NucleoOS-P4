# NucleoOS Anima — engineering rules (ESP32-P4)

Invariants every change must respect. They come from real crashes and audits; the "why" is
recorded so nobody relaxes them by accident. Keep this file short and true.

## 1. Memory tiers

- **Internal SRAM is the scarce tier** (~200-240 KB free at runtime with Wi-Fi, LVGL and the web
  server up). PSRAM (32 MB) is plentiful. Every design question is "does this need SRAM?".
- **Static storage:** a `static` array lands in internal `.bss` by default. Tag cold/bulky statics
  with `NV_PSRAM_BSS` (`nv_kernel/include/nv_mem_attr.h`, portable: empty on the host) so they move
  to PSRAM. Allowed only for data touched from task context — never ISR-shared data, DMA
  descriptors, or buffers used while the flash cache is disabled. Fine for `fread()` targets
  (SDMMC bounces) and NVS get/set (the flash driver bounces non-internal buffers).
- **Prefer lazy allocation per open/close** for app state (allocate in `build()`, free on
  `LV_EVENT_DELETE`) over permanent statics; PSRAM heap via `heap_caps_malloc(MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)`.
  A plain `malloc()` under 16 KB lands in INTERNAL SRAM (`SPIRAM_MALLOC_ALWAYSINTERNAL`).
- Measure with `python tools/ci/check_budgets.py build` (what CI enforces) or `idf.py size-components`.
  (the P4 internal bss section is `.dram1.bss`, PSRAM bss is `.ext_ram.bss`).

## 2. Task stacks and flash access (the crash nobody sees coming)

- Any internal-flash access — **reads included**: `nvs_*`, `esp_partition_read/write`,
  `esp_flash_*`, OTA — disables the cache and **asserts that the running task's stack is in DRAM**
  (`spi_flash/cache_utils.c`). A task with a PSRAM stack aborts the moment it touches flash.
- Therefore: `xTaskCreateWithCaps(..., MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)` for any task that never touches flash
  (nv_bgwork, nv_lowmem, sd_mon, audio feeders, TTS, ANIMA workers, WASM sound, store fetchers,
  video player). SD card I/O, sockets and TLS are fine on a PSRAM stack. A caps task must end
  with `vTaskDeleteWithCaps(NULL)` (IDF 5.5 frees a self-deleting caps task through a short helper
  task), never `vTaskDelete(NULL)`, which leaks its stack and TCB (from another task:
  `vTaskDeleteWithCaps(handle)`). A task that runs arbitrary LVGL handlers (keydeck, nv_mqtt)
  stays internal: some handler, somewhere, writes NVS. `xTaskCreate` stacks are always internal
  SRAM, whatever their size.
- `nv_config_*` is the one sanctioned exception: it detects a PSRAM stack and proxies the NVS
  operation to an internal-stack helper task (`nv_config.cpp`). Everything else that needs NVS
  from a worker must marshal to the LVGL thread or a dedicated internal-stack task
  (e.g. `nv_backup` export task, OTA mark-valid task).
- READS through an existing `esp_partition_mmap` mapping go through the cache and are fine from
  any stack; creating or releasing the mapping (`esp_partition_mmap`/`munmap`) stops the cache and
  needs an internal stack like any other flash call.

## 3. LVGL thread discipline

- LVGL objects/timers are touched only on the LVGL task, or under `lvgl_port_lock()` from another
  task. Post work instead of running it under a foreign-held lock when it involves an app's
  teardown/relaunch (WASM abort handshake, Recents thumbnail, SD writes):
  `nv_ui_open_app_id_async()`, `nv_ui_go_home_async()`, `lv_async_call()`.
- esp_timer callbacks run on the esp_timer task (3.5 KB stack) which also drives the LVGL tick:
  no SD/flash/blocking work there — spawn a task.
- Every app hangs its cleanup on the root `LV_EVENT_DELETE`: delete timers, cancel
  `lv_async_call`s, bump generation counters for in-flight bgwork jobs, free per-open buffers.
- Renderer traps: no `shadow`, `transform_*`, `opa` layers or `clip_corner` (P4 SW renderer hangs).

## 4. Audio

- One PCM stream owns the DAC (`nv_audio_pcm_begin_as`). MUSIC waits for it; SFX/VOICE give up
  after 400 ms. A failed `begin` means the stream mutex is NOT yours: never `pcm_end`/`flush`
  what you did not begin (`nv_audio_pcm_owner()` tells who owns the sink).

## 5. SD card

- Use `nv_sd_fopen/nv_sd_fclose` (or `nv_sd_session_begin/end` around `opendir` loops) for any
  file held open longer than an instant; the hot-unmount drain only protects counted sessions.
- Never `remove(path); rename(tmp, path)` blindly: check the writer's errors first and on a rename
  failure KEEP the temp file (it is the only good copy). See `commit_tmp()` in nv_anima.
- FATFS: LFN on, `max_files` 16, rename refuses to overwrite.

## 6. Untrusted input

- Every parser fed from the SD or the LAN (`/api/media/play`, `/api/video/play`, WASM imports,
  store/OTA manifests) computes chunk strides in 64-bit, requires monotonic progress, and bounds
  every table by the file size. Clamp every guest-supplied loop bound in WASM host imports —
  native loops are outside the opcode meter and the terminate flag.
- The web API is paired (nv_auth): a new `/api` route is authenticated by default, and the public
  list in `server_start()` (info, auth/status, pair) stays that short. `settings.nvb` (Wi-Fi creds)
  is never served, even to a paired client; `teacher.json` is (the browser copilot needs it).
- Secrets never go through `NV_LOG*`: the log ring is served by `/api/logs`. The pairing code is
  printed with plain `printf` (serial console only) for that reason.
- Remote firmware is trusted only through the release signature (nv_ota, tools/ota_sign.py): the
  manifest signs version + sha256 + size, and the bytes written to the slot, plus the version
  inside them, must match before the boot pointer moves. Never add an install path that skips it:
  Install from SD needs the signed manifest beside the image too. Unsigned builds go over USB.
- Bounds are LENGTHS, never pointers: `size <= end - p`, not `p + size > end`. On the RV32 device a
  32-bit size wraps the address space (the MP4 box walker ran backwards off its buffer that way).
- Path guards compare what the filesystem resolves, not bytes: FAT/exFAT match names
  case-insensitively and FatFs drops trailing dots/spaces (`/SETTINGS.NVB`, `/web./index.html`).
  See `nv_web_util.cpp` `component_is`.
- A parser of LAN/SD input lives in a pure module (no ESP-IDF/FreeRTOS/LVGL; allocator behind
  `#ifdef ESP_PLATFORM`) with a unit test and a fuzzer in `tests/host`, run at 64 AND 32 bit:
  `vp_avi.c`, `vp_mp4.c`, `nv_web_util.cpp`, pl_mpeg. See `tests/host/README.md`.

## 7. Opening files

- Never hard-code which app opens a file type. Open with `nv_open_file()` / `nv_open_with()` and
  register what your app handles as an `NvOpenHandler` (docs/FILE_ASSOCIATIONS.md). A handler's
  MIME list must match what the decoder really supports, and its id is persisted in the user's
  defaults: never rename it.
- An app opened on a file reads `nv_open_intent()` at the top of `build()` (it survives rebuilds);
  leaving an in-app intent view calls `nv_open_finish()`, not a hand-rolled "go back".

## 8. Config and persistence

- `sdkconfig` is fully reproducible from `sdkconfig.defaults*` (verified: 0 drift). Put every
  durable Kconfig choice in the defaults, never only in menuconfig. An existing sdkconfig does NOT
  pick up a new default for an option it already lists as `# ... is not set`: a choice that
  prevents a crash also gets an `#error` guard next to its user (e.g. esp-hosted PSRAM buffers,
  `nv_wifi.cpp`).
- `managed_components/` is downloaded, never edited: a local edit vanishes on the next version bump
  or clean checkout (the esp-hosted RX retry did). Change their behaviour through Kconfig; if a
  source change is unavoidable, keep it as `tools/patches/*.patch` applied by a script CI runs
  (like `tools/ci/fetch_wamr.sh`).
- NVS keys ≤ 15 chars, strings ≤ 4000 bytes. The launcher order and folders persist app IDS
  (schema v3: `lo3`, `lf3_<f>`; older index-based records are migrated once), so registration order
  in `nv_apps.cpp` may change freely — but an app id is persisted state: renaming one sends its
  tile to the end of the Home screen and out of its folder.

## 9. Interrupts and the 2D engines

- **One interrupt source, one CPU.** `esp_intr_alloc` routes a shared source per CPU, on the core
  that registers the handler. If two drivers that share a source (DW_GDMA: DPI panel + CSI camera;
  DMA2D: display frame-buffer copy + PPA + JPEG; I2C0: every bus device) register from different
  cores, the source is routed to both CPUs and each vector holds only its own handler: the CPU
  whose handler does not match keeps re-entering `shared_intr_isr` until the other CPU clears the
  bit. Inside the flash-operation handshake the other CPU is parked with its non-IRAM interrupts
  masked, nobody clears it, and the interrupt watchdog resets the chip (reproduced on hardware:
  camera open + `/api/bench/nvs` = reset in < 20k flash reads). So: create and delete such drivers
  on **core 0**, where the boot-time owners live (`nv_camera.c` marshals its bring-up/teardown to a
  core-0 helper; the LVGL task is pinned to core 1 and must not do it inline). Check with
  `GET /api/intr` while the feature runs: a source must never appear under both CPUs.
- **Never free a handler with its event still pending.** Stop the producer first (sensor
  stream-off), let the in-flight transfer complete into the live handler, then stop and delete
  the controller. A late event on a line whose handler is gone is the same endless storm.
- **Every PPA and JPEG job goes through `nv_2d.h`** (`nv_2d_srm`, `nv_2d_jpeg_decode/encode`), never
  `ppa_do_*` / `jpeg_*_process` directly. JPEG can only use 2D-DMA channel 0 on this silicon; queued
  behind a PPA job its timeout expires before it starts and IDF's `dma2d_force_end` then corrupts
  the 2D-DMA queue. The shared lock makes that impossible.
- Forensics without a cable: `GET /api/crash` (panic reason, `storm` = the interrupt sources a
  stalled CPU had asserted, recorded by `nv_irqwatch` into RTC memory), `GET /api/crash/dump`
  (`tools/decode-coredump.ps1 -Url`), `tools/coredump-summary.py` when the matching ELF is gone.

## 10. Display: the panel is double-buffered (nv_disp)

- The DSI panel has two frame buffers; `nv_disp` swaps them at vsync, so nothing is ever written
  into the buffer the panel is scanning (no tearing). Landscape renders LVGL straight into the back
  buffer (DIRECT mode, zero copy); rotated modes render strips that the PPA rotates into it.
  `GET /api/display` shows the mode, fps, vsync wait and `violations` (must stay 0).
- **Never call `esp_lcd_dpi_panel_get_frame_buffer()` outside nv_disp.** Readers (screenshot,
  thumbnails) and direct writers that bypass LVGL (video, second screen) use
  `nv_disp_front_begin()/nv_disp_front_end()`: it hands out the buffer on screen and holds off the
  next swap for as short as possible (copy, then work unlocked).
- **Pictures produced outside LVGL (video, a game canvas) are an nv_disp layer** (`nv_disp_layer_set`
  + `nv_disp_layer_update` per new picture): the draw callback puts the newest picture into the back
  buffer while the frame is composed, so it reaches the panel at vsync with no tearing; for a frame
  that only carries a picture already on screen, nv_disp copies it or redraws it, whichever it has
  measured cheaper (`GET /api/display`: layer_*). See video_app.cpp. Detach it while LVGL UI covers
  the rectangle, and never hold the front buffer while calling the layer API. The immediate `nv_hal_video_blit` (write into the frame on screen + a direct
  region carried across swaps, cleared with `nv_hal_video_blit_end`) remains for synchronous
  callers, but it can tear.
- Cache rules for PSRAM buffers shared with DMA: write back (C2M) what the CPU wrote before a DMA
  reads it; invalidate (M2C) before the CPU reads what a DMA wrote. `esp_cache_msync` **refuses M2C
  with `ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_UNALIGNED`** (it logs and does nothing): M2C only on cache-line aligned
  address and size. Drivers (PPA, JPEG, async memcpy) already sync their own inputs/outputs.
- Big PSRAM-to-PSRAM copies go through `nv_2d_copy()` (AXI-GDMA bursts): on this board the CPU
  manages ~40 MB/s when the camera and the panel DMA load PSRAM.
- **The panel's frame DMA is re-armed by an interrupt every frame** (DW_GDMA done-ISR, rev < 3
  silicon). If that ISR cannot run, the panel underruns and shows a light-blue frame. It must run
  during flash writes, so `CONFIG_LCD_DSI_ISR_CACHE_SAFE=y` stays on in the firmware AND the recovery
  (`recovery/sdkconfig.defaults`). The CSI camera shares DW_GDMA, so it needs
  `CONFIG_CAM_CTLR_MIPI_CSI_ISR_CACHE_SAFE=y` as well. Anything these ISRs call (`on_vsync`,
  `cam_on_finished`) is `IRAM_ATTR` and touches only internal RAM. `GET /api/display`
  `late_refreshes` / `refresh_gap_max_us` show refresh gaps. `GET /api/bench/nvs?n=300&w=1` gives a
  flash-write storm to check them under: they must stay 0 / about one frame (14.4 ms).

## 11. Keyboard and mouse: every screen, no exceptions

A USB / Bluetooth keyboard and mouse can appear at any time; every screen must work with the
keyboard alone. Navigation is central (`nv_ui/nv_ui_focus.cpp`, key map in `nv_ui_focus.h`): it
picks up any visible, enabled, clickable object with its own CLICKED / VALUE_CHANGED (etc.)
handler, so the rules are about staying reachable, not about registering:

- Controls are clickable objects with the action handler **on themselves** (not only on a parent
  via bubbling, not decided from coordinates, not swipe-only). Otherwise `nv_focus_include()`.
- Create children in reading order: tree order is Tab order.
- `nv_focus_prefer()` on the main action / first field; `nv_focus_skip()` on click-catching
  decorations and scrims.
- Esc = back: sub-pages use `nv_ui_set_back()`; nothing is closable only by a gesture.
- Text through `nv_kit_textarea*` / `nv_ime_bind*` (physical keyboard types into it).
- App shortcuts only via `nv_ui_set_key_handler()`; never consume Tab, Esc, Win or Alt chords.
- `LV_OBJ_FLAG_USER_1..4` are reserved by the focus engine (skip, styled, prefer, include).
- WASM apps poll `nv_kbd_state()`: arrows/WASD, Enter/Space confirm, Esc back/pause.

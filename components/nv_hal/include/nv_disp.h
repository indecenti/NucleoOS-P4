// nv_disp — the display compositor: tear-free output on the MIPI-DSI panel.
//
// The DPI controller scans a frame buffer out of PSRAM continuously at ~60 Hz. Writing into the
// buffer being scanned shows half an old and half a new frame (tearing). nv_disp owns TWO frame
// buffers: one on screen ("front"), one being composed ("back"). A finished frame becomes the front
// by a buffer switch that the DPI driver applies at the next frame boundary (vsync), and nothing is
// written into a buffer while it is scanned.
//
//   * Landscape (rotation 0): LVGL renders in DIRECT mode straight into the back buffer — no copy at
//     all. LVGL itself carries the previous frame's changes into the new back buffer.
//   * Rotated (90/180/270): LVGL renders in PARTIAL mode; the PPA rotates each rendered strip
//     directly into the back buffer, and nv_disp carries the previous frame's changes (minus what
//     the new frame redraws anyway).
//
// Other code that touches the panel pixels goes through the front-buffer API below instead of
// esp_lcd_dpi_panel_get_frame_buffer(): readers (screenshot, Recents thumbnail) and direct writers
// that bypass LVGL (video player, second screen). Holding the front buffer only blocks the next
// swap; LVGL keeps rendering the next frame meanwhile.

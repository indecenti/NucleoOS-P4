// nv_hid_host — USB HID host: keyboard, mouse and gamepads on the OTG-HS Type-C (directly or
// behind a hub). Keyboard keys inject into the focused IME field exactly like the on-screen
// keyboard (nv_ime_inject_*), delivered on the LVGL thread; the mouse drives an LVGL pointer indev with an on-screen cursor, so
// it clicks/scrolls the whole UI; gamepads become nv_pad players. Requires host mode ("usbhost"
// config) — same bus as nv_usb_audio, which owns usb_host_install; call this AFTER
// nv_usb_audio_init().
//
// Keyboard and mouse use the boot protocol (every real one supports it), US or Italian keymap.
// Gamepads / joysticks are generic HID: the report descriptor is parsed on connect
// (nv_hid_gamepad.c) and mapped to the standard layout with the SDL_GameControllerDB mappings
// (nv_pad.c); Switch pads get their USB handshake, DualShock 4 / DualSense rumble + light bar.
// XInput pads (Xbox) aren't HID: nv_xinput.cpp handles them.

// nv_term — remote text control of the Terminal (the /api/term/* web routes).
//
// Everything the shell and its terminal programs print on the screen is also teed, ANSI escapes
// stripped, into a 64 KB PSRAM capture ring addressed by a monotonic byte sequence ("seq"): a
// reader keeps its cursor and asks for what came after it. Lines run through here are echoed on
// the screen like typed commands, so the person at the device sees what a remote tool does.
//
// All functions: any task except the LVGL thread (they take the LVGL port lock or wait on the UI).
